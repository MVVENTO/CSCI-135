Write a program smaller3.cpp that asks the user to input three integer numbers, and prints out the smallest of the three.

(Hint: There are many possible solutions here. One possible strategy: Given numbers x, y, and z, you can first compare x and y, take whichever is smaller and compare it with z.)

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    
    int x, y, z;
    int small;
   
    
    cout << "Enter the first number: " << endl;
    cin >> x;
    
    cout << "Enter the second number: " << endl;
    cin >> y;
    
    cout << "Enter the third number: " << endl;
    cin >> z;
    
    if (x < y)
         small = x;
     else
         small = y;
    
    cout << "The smaller of the two is " << ((small < z) ? small : z) << "." << endl;

}
